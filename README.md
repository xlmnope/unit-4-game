Each gem has a number of points assigned to it. Each time you click a gem, points are added to your game total. The goal of the game is for your game total to match the "crystals needed" number , without going over. 

I built this game for an assignment through UCSD's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This assignment increased my Javascript skills.
